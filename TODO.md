### Responsive Language Toggle Implementation

**Changes Made:**
1. **Base Styles**: Mobile-first approach with:
   - Container: min-width: 90px, min-height: 40px
   - Active flag: 42px × 28px
   - Inactive flag: 26px × 18px
   - Dot: 6px × 6px

2. **Media Queries Added**:
   - Tablet (768px+): Larger flags and container
   - Desktop (992px+): Even larger flags for better visibility
   - Mobile (575px-): Smaller sizes for compact mobile view
   - Extra small (320px-): Minimal sizes for very small screens
   - Tablet portrait (576px-767px): Intermediate sizes

3. **Responsive Breakpoints**:
   - 320px and below: Extra small devices
   - 575px and below: Mobile devices
   - 576px-767px: Tablet portrait
   - 768px-991px: Tablet landscape
   - 992px and above: Desktop

**Testing Notes:**
- The language toggle now adapts to all screen sizes
- Flags maintain proper aspect ratio across devices
- Container padding and spacing adjusts proportionally
- Animation and hover effects remain consistent
